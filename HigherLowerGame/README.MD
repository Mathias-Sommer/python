This program features a built-in login system, currently supporting only hardcoded credentials for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you would integrate it with a database to verify user credentials securely.

Once logged in successfully, you will be directed to Form 2, where the game is played.

Here's how the game works:
- You will be shown a number.
- Your task is to predict whether the next number generated will be higher or lower than the current one.
- To make your prediction, simply click the "Lower" or "Higher" button.
- Both the current and next numbers are randomly generated.

The game keeps track of your streak with a built-in score feature.

If you guess incorrectly and "lose" the round, your score will be reset to zero.

Enjoy playing!
